/* MAX9657 Port Mode options
 *
 * Important notes regarding use of MAX9657_MODE_CCLED mode:
 *
 * NOTE 1: In this mode, the pins are open-drain current sink, for connection to LED cathodes
 * NOTE 2: If using a 5V supply, the datasheet recommends using an 82ohm resistor in series
 *         with each LED and limiting the current drive strength to 20mA. So we set default
 *         drive strength here at 19.5mA.  Use ::setIntensity(15) to change if needed.
 *         If using a 3.3V supply, 24mA drive strength can be used with no series resistors
 *
 * Please refer to the MAX9657 datasheet for more information.
